# Base64 Demo 

A quick example showing how to decode and parse JSON encoded as Base64. 

## Overview

Passing information can be challenging.
In some circumstances, its helpful to encode the payload as base64.
When doing this remember a decode is required at the opposite end.

The example uses a JSON payload and encodess with base64. 
Enter an encoded JSON string and the application will attempt to decode the information.
An example JSON is used in the demo, but this can be amended for any structure required.
